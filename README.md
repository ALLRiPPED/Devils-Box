## Some stuff someone said at some point.

"I don’t regret the things I’ve done, I regret the things I didn’t do when I had the chance."

"In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure."

"I feel like a slice of butter, on a big oh pile of flapjacks. "

"Madness? No......this is SPARTA!!!!"
