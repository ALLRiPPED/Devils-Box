"I don’t regret the things I’ve done, I regret the things I didn’t do when I had the chance."

"In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure."

"I feel like a slice of butter, on a big oh pile of flapjacks. "

## WHAT PI DOES THIS WORK ON ?

Devils Box has been tested and works on PI ZERO, PI 3, PI4. *BUT MOST THINGS ARE FOR PI 4. see below*

*WORKS ON ALL PIS (with RetroPie installed)*
  
  ~ Getting packs and indivaul "things & stuff" from web.
  
  ~ Expand Memory
  
  ~ Themes and stuff like that
  
*PI 4 ONLY (with RetroPie installed)*
  
  ~ Most Tools 
  
  ~ Some Emus. Mugen/WINE and Model 3 for examples.

Devils Box also (again in theory) works on any linux device that retropie is isntalled.

We have tested on 3 seperate pcs with linux running on them. One pc didnt have Retropie at all. 

## DEVILS RETROPIE IMAGE ONLY?

- NOPE. Built to work on as many as possible. Tested on the following
  
  ~  Supreme Ultra------------------Some Tools cause slight issues, other than worked fine.
  
  ~ Virtual Man---------------------Some tools cause slight issues, other than that worked fine.
  
  ~ Diablos Arcade------------------Works Great.
  
  ~ Pleasure Paradise---------------Some tools cause slight issues, other than that woked fine.
  
  ~ Images with irregular retropie roms paths. UNLIKELY TO WORK WITH EDITS TO PATHS.
