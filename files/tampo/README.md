## TAMPO 
## Theme And Music Plus Overlay v1.05
## More Information
This is a script that is similar to Kio Diekin's theme and music script, but mine was made only by me and this is in no way the works he premeries in this video:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0nUTGeLT8o<br>

This installs all the associated themes, background music, videoloadingscreens, and of course the splashscreens and exitscreens<br>
for Halloween and Christmas Holiday themes and Stranger Things Theme plus my own concoction theme set Carbonite, for now, hopefully more to come!<br>
This also installs the BGM Control Script from here [retropie_music_overlay](https://github.com/ALLRiPPED/retropie_music_overlay) as this is the complete<br>
merging of the BGM as well as the original idea for the TAMPO.<br>
It will do the full shabang, that means when you run tampo from your retropie menu and choose a theme it will restart emulationstation, not the pi itself,<br>
so if you want to see the splashscreen you will have to manually reboot the pi, but you can turn off the exit splashes and the videoloading screens.<br><br>
This is open source and free for anyone to use, just drop me a little credit is all I ask.<br>
The script has a one line install, so no need to clone a repo (it does all that for you).<br>
Now if you have any sugesstions or addition please fork the repo and hit me up with a pull request.<br>
