## TAMO+ (formally known as TAMPO)
## Theme And Music Plus Overlay v1.45
## More Information
This is a script that is similar to Kio Diekin's theme and music script, but mine was made only by me and this is in no way the works he premeries in this video:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0nUTGeLT8o<br>

This can install all the associated themes, background music, videoloadingscreens, and of course the splashscreens and exitscreens<br>
for two Holiday themes and my own concoction theme set Carbonite, for now, hopefully more to come!<br>
Also it removes everything from the RetroPie Menu that will be included in TAMO+ (IE: esthemes, audiosettings, & splashscreen.rp for vanilla retropie users)<br>
And for those using Supreme Ultra builds it removes Audio Settings, Controller Settings, & Visual Settings from the RetroPie Menu.<br>
All of which can be found from within the TAMO+ script itself.<br>
This installs the same BGM Control Script from here [retropie_music_overlay](https://github.com/ALLRiPPED/retropie_music_overlay) as this is the complete merging of the BGM as well as the original idea for TAMPO and TAMO+.<br>
It will do the full shabang, that means when you run tamo+ from your retropie menu and choose one of the preconfigured themes it will restart emulationstation, not the pi itself, so if you want to see the splashscreen you will have to manually reboot the pi, and you can turn the exit splashes and the videoloading screens on or off.<br><br>
Now when installing you are able to keep your RetroPie Menu items, or if you choose to remove your Menu items you now restore it back to the orignal. Compatible with Supreme Ultra Builds.<br>
The install and main scripts now let you install the themesets and music seprately later after installation of TAMO+.<br>
This is open source and free for anyone to use, just drop me a little credit is all I ask.<br>
The script has a one line install, so no need to clone a repo (it does all that for you).<br>
Now if you have any sugesstions or addition please fork the repo and hit me up with a pull request.<br>

## Future Plans
Not Done Add more Holiday based themes.
Not Done Adding the ability to the control script to change the size of the overlay.
